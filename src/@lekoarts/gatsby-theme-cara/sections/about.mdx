## About

> I love to solve problems, improve processes, and just figure things out. I've worked on some really cool projects over the years but no matter where I am at or what I am working I take great pride in helping people with their technical problems.

No matter what position I hold, I always become the go to for problem solving, and that's the role I enjoy the most.

When I'm not working, reading, or learning; my wife, daughter, and dogs take up the rest of my time in the best way possible.

They are the reason I work hard and will always continue to work hard for them. I owe every bit of success to my wife, as without her I wouldn't try so hard to achieve more and be the best version of myself that I can be, she always pushes me and makes me better.

Some of the technologies and frameworks I am comfortable with:

Typescript, JavaScript, C#, Python, Node.JS, Vite, CRA, Gatsby, Next.JS, Nest.JS, SQL, PHP, .NET

Some of the things I am learning:

Svelte, GO

But more importantly, the real reason you are here, my favorites

Movies = Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse, Gattaca

Books = Harry Potter, The Lies of Locke Lamora, Off to Be the Wizard

TV Shows = Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Stranger Things
